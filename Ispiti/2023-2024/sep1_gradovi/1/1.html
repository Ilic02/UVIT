      <p class="paragraph">
        Nice grew up betweeen the sea and the mountains, around one of the finest bays in the world,
        the "Baie Des Anges" and is now the 5th biggest city in France. The city permanently opened
        itself up to the world in the second half of the 19th century, with the influx of a large
        number of aristocrats and leaders from Europe, who were seduced by the beauty and climate of 
        the small Mediterranenan town back then. In 1860, Nice became a part of France and is proud
        of showing visitors its different identity, forged by a history that goes back to the Nikaia, 
        pre-dating the Roman Empire. In the narrow streets of Old Nice you will be transported far from
        Provence, to somewhere in Italy. Indeed, over Place Garibaldi, with its atmosphere of Turin, 
        presides the statue of the hero of modern Italy.
